    Some of the projects Reid has enjoyed working on:

    Fly Fishing Database
    -A database created for a fictional fly-fishing company that tracks nearly all aspects of the Revenue, Expense, and Production business cycles.
    -Project specifications included 17 complex, custom stored queries to be run by the “customer” as well as general relationships between entities that needed to be tracked.
    -Design of the entire SQL database, including entities, relationships, processes, and attributes contained within.
    -Production of hundreds of pieces of sample data necessary for testing database functionality.
    -Creating milestone progress reports and a final summary to update the client at each stage of the process.

    GitHub Repositories
    -A personal GitHub repository containing the bulk of Reid’s collegiate programming projects.
    -Projects range from the start of learning new concepts, to utilizing multiple skills to accomplish specific tasks.
    -These repositories stand as testament to the skills Reid has developed in his studies since returning to college.
