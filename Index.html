    Welcome to Reid Dysart's personal website'
    The purpose of this site is to provide a brief overview of Reid Dysart’s work history, education, and skill sets. After initially stumbling to engage with college over a decade ago, Reid decided to build a career around sales and business development skills bolstered by his outgoing personality and desire to meet the expectations of the most demanding clients. His path moved from equipment sales, to roofing and construction sales, then to sales team development within the telecommunications industry. From there, he worked in business development for an import-export tax and duty recovery service provider, and transitioned back into the telecom industry in a corporate and government sales role. A layoff provided the opportunity to reattempt his college education and with a strengthened resolve to completing his education, Reid has been powering through his degree program with flying colors and will complete his degree in May 2021.
