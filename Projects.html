    <h4 style="text-align:center">Some of the projects Reid has enjoyed working on:</h4>

    <h4>Fly Fishing Database</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A database created for a fictional fly-fishing company that tracks nearly all aspects of the Revenue, Expense, and Production business cycles.</li>
        <li>Project specifications included 17 complex, custom stored queries to be run by the “customer” as well as general relationships between entities that needed to be tracked.</li>
        <li>Design of the entire SQL database, including entities, relationships, processes, and attributes contained within.</li>
        <li>Production of hundreds of pieces of sample data necessary for testing database functionality.</li>
        <li>Creating milestone progress reports and a final summary to update the client at each stage of the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>GitHub Repositories</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A personal GitHub repository containing the bulk of Reid’s collegiate programming projects.</li>
        <li>Projects range from the start of learning new concepts, to utilizing multiple skills to accomplish specific tasks.</li>
        <li>These repositories stand as testament to the skills Reid has developed in his studies since returning to college.</li>
    </ul>
