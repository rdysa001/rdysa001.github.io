    About Reid

    Reid has always been fond of having goals and projects to keep him busy. At the age of 12, he was running a daily paper route through the pre-dawn streets of Anchorage, AK. Through the rest of his secondary education, he worked as a soccer referee, a camp counselor, paintball field manager, rock climbing and swim instructor, and as the manager of an indoor skate park. He has a passion for learning new things and excels in roles that require growth and adaptation.

    Some of Reid’s hobbies include discovering new music artists and podcasts, games, bike riding, reading, learning new skills, and taking care of/entertaining his Great Dane, Freya.
