    <h2 style="text-align:center">About Reid</h2>
    <p>
        Reid has always been fond of having goals and projects to keep him busy. At the age of 12, he was running a daily paper route through the pre-dawn streets of Anchorage, AK. Through the rest of his secondary education, he worked as a soccer referee, a camp counselor, paintball field manager, rock climbing and swim instructor, and as the manager of an indoor skate park. He has a passion for learning new things and excels in roles that require growth and adaptation.

    <p>
        Some of Reid’s hobbies include discovering new music artists and podcasts, games, bike riding, reading, learning new skills, and taking care of/entertaining his Great Dane, Freya.
